# Groovy NullPointerException Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Groovy: the `NullPointerException`.  The `calculate` function shows how easily a `NullPointerException` can occur if null values are passed as arguments.  The solution demonstrates safe handling of potentially null values.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Groovy installed.
3. Run the `bug.groovy` script to see the `NullPointerException`.  (It will throw an exception).
4. Run the `bugSolution.groovy` script to see the corrected version, which handles nulls gracefully.
